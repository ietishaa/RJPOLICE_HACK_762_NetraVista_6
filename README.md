# System-for-geotagging-cameras

## Introduction
This project implements a comprehensive Geo-Tagging System for privately owned surveillance cameras. The system aims to enhance public safety by efficiently recording and storing the geographical locations of private cameras, facilitating law enforcement access, and ensuring standardized metadata.

## Features
-Geographical Mapping: User-friendly interface for camera owners to input precise geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of their private cameras.
-Standardized Metadata: Establishment of a standardized metadata format accompanying geo-tagged information, including camera specifications, owner contact details, and camera visibility range.
-Secure Data Storage: Robust data security measures implemented to protect the privacy and confidentiality of camera owner information and footage.
-Law Enforcement Access: Facilitation of law enforcement agency's access to the geo-tagged database to request relevant footage in specific locations during criminal investigations.
-Integration with Surveillance Networks: Compatibility with existing surveillance networks and technologies for seamless data sharing and collaboration.
-Maintenance and Repair Mechanism: Mechanism to check if a specific camera has gone out of place, automatically notifying for repair/reorientation.
-Object Identification via Image Processing: Utilization of AI and ML for image processing of large data from video streams to identify specific types of objects (human, bus, car, motorcycle).
-Community Crowdsourcing: Inclusion of a community reporting module for real-time reporting of issues or changes in the camera's environment.

## Prerequisites
GPS tagging for each camera in the city/locality.
Area-wise proximity feature for locations using Google Maps.
Functionality checks for each camera linked, triggering alerts for repair/reorientation as needed.
Use of AI and ML for assessing major crowd congregations and potential law and order situations.

## How to Run
### Frontend:
Open the frontend directory.
Use a compatible web server to host the HTML, CSS, and JS files.
Access the interface through the hosted server.

### Backend (Django):
Open the backend directory.
Install the required Django dependencies using:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Django development server:
Copy code
python manage.py runserver

## Integration:
Ensure that the frontend is configured to communicate with the backend API endpoints.

## Additional Notes
The project is designed to optimize public safety, enhance law enforcement responses, and promote community collaboration.
Privacy-preserving practices are implemented to maintain public trust in the geo-tagging initiative.
